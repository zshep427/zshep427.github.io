		  			<div class="unchartedAbout">
		  				<p>
			  			Wordplay is a word-based puzzle game where you need to rack up as high a score as possible before running out of plays on the board. The score of each word is the sum of the tile values in the top left corner of each tile. After playing a word, the tiles above the played word will drop and new letters will spawn in their place. The rack above the board previews the next letter that will spawn in that column.  
			  			</p>

			  			<p>	
			  			Selecting two letters will swap their position on the board. Use them wisely, though; you have a limited number of swaps. See the tiles with red numbers in the top right corner? In order to get more swaps, play words that include red numbered tiles and whose length meet or exceed the number in the top right of the red numbered tiles. 
			  			</p>

			  			<p>
			  			Design, art, and engineering were all done by me. The game was made using Unity and scripted entirely in C#.

		  				<p>
			  			I provided support for the Design team on Uncharted 4. I worked with designers to implement AI Navigation systems across both U4 SP and MP. After implementing the systems, I handled all related bug fixes for the duration of development ensuring the levels met the quality Naughty Dog is known for. I also worked with programmers to fix bugs related to the Hide Characters and Orbit Camera features of U4's Photo Mode.

				<div class="unchartedAbout">
	  				<p>
		  			I served as Test Lead for three of Uncharted 4's story chapters, <i>Hector Alcazar</i>, <i>Once a Thief...</i>, and <i>Light's Out</i>. I coordinated between QA and Programming in order to maintain game stability throughout the duration of the project. Toward the end of the project, I worked with Technical Art Directors and Programmers to ensure necessary level visibility rebuilds occurred and were integrated into the final disc.
