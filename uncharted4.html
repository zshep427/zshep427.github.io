		  				<p>
			  			Set three years after the events of UNCHARTED 3: Drake’s Deception, Nathan Drake has presumably left the world of fortune hunting behind. However, it doesn’t take long for adventure to come calling when Drake’s brother, Sam, resurfaces seeking his help to save his own life and offering an adventure Drake can’t resist.  
			  			</p>

			  			<p>
						On the hunt for Captain Henry Avery’s long-lost treasure, Sam and Drake set off to find Libertalia, the pirate utopia deep in the forests of Madagascar. UNCHARTED 4: A Thief’s End takes players on a journey around the globe, through jungle isles, urban cities and snow-capped peaks on the search for Avery’s fortune.

			  			I supported both the Design and QA teams during Uncharted 4's development.

		  				<p>
			  			I provided support for the Design team on Uncharted 4. I worked with designers to implement AI Navigation systems across both U4 SP and MP. After implementing the systems, I handled all related bug fixes for the duration of development ensuring the levels met the quality Naughty Dog is known for. I also worked with programmers to fix bugs related to the Hide Characters and Orbit Camera features of U4's Photo Mode.

	  				<p>
		  			I served as Test Lead for three of Uncharted 4's story chapters, <i>Hector Alcazar</i>, <i>Once a Thief...</i>, and <i>Light's Out</i>. I coordinated between QA and Programming in order to maintain game stability throughout the duration of the project. Toward the end of the project, I worked with Technical Art Directors and Programmers to ensure necessary level visibility rebuilds occurred and were integrated into the final disc.
