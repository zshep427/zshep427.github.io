		  				<p>
			  			Uncharted 4: A Thief's End is a action-adventure game following Nathan Drake as he's lured out of retirement by the unexpected arrival of his thought-deceased older brother, Sam. Nate and Sam are in search of Henry Avery's lost treasure following the Gunsway heist in 1695. They must compete with Rafe Adler, a greedy millionaire willing to do anything to find the treasure first, and his partner, Nadine Ross, the leader of the private military company Shoreline. 
			  			</p>

			  			<p>	
			  			Uncharted 4 also includes a multiplayer component where teams of 5 compete with one another across varying game modes using unique gameplay tactics such as the grappling hook, mystical power ups, and AI Sidekicks. 
			  			</p>

			  			I worked with both the Design and QA departments on at Naughty Dog from November 2014 to Present on Uncharted 4.
